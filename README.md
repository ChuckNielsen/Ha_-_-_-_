# Ha_-_-_-_ Step 2: Automating with Sikulix.jar + Screen Saver Project
This repo is designed to be an interactive programming tool that sits on your desktop waiting to repeate what its observed faster to allow you to intelligently enjoy certian automation hurdles. 

# Hard @pps is the future bridge of interacting with traditional computers and wearable AR/VR devices
Training steps for ML: in session///post session///test results/// ScrapeSave Training Results /// Questioneers filled out automatically and only sometimes manually at any step

Steps - 

1 Auto Hot Keys

2 Sikilux

3 .yaml, Conda, Docker, Kubernettes, Pythonm, NodeDB, JavaScript, Webapps, Site Host Services, VPN 's with ability to rotate every step of an automated task

4 Link Building + SEO Marketing Tools, Future Trends, word2image, 

5 Content Generation, Social Network Sharing, Copywriting, Service Schedulers, 

6 CheckPoints of Approval + SingleCommunicationPoint. 

7 applying info obtained and learned thus far - implment ml models in various focus in reproducable vENV with UI task completation focus + organize dashboard data for day tomorrow 

8 re-testing origional hurdles in automating creation of all steps up to hear in another automation API/Language/Market/Software

9 have a next step game shark like avatar guide 3d media agency content created to generate even more layers and options 

10 cretique and revamp delivery of approval items and generate timeline reports for these segments all forms filled automaticly from keyword+analytically generated task lists 


# Follow steps below to begin continue setting up:

1: Open cmd and download this git repo from copying url in address bar or green button above 

   The .apk are AutoHotKey files that are saved in notebook files with the .txt at the end of the file name (not always noticed) make sure to click file name and drop the ".apk" 
   extension  (HINT:: for future name changes remember to change the file type to all files).

   Then open the auto hot key software for Windows ($$$$$) and convert the file using Ahk2Exe Script to Exe Converter
   Now you can launch the file as a non editable .exe file
   Schedule to auto launch at startup


2: Project 0 - Create your own sharable "AMP-BOARD" macro "PACKS": keyboard overlay pack for photoshop/email/open program/program shortcuts based on job or cycle in day/project.
               Keyboard combo shortcuts: C+D auto types a website in a new browser window that just opened /// type a sentence /// open a file with CMD and run a .py script // launch 
               react-app from IDE or VM // Timers to play chime/alarm after delays or data capture compretions (retrival, trade, processing moments to make your screen less idally                       restrictive).

               Start by creating 2 .apk files: one with keyboard shortcuts for web browsing to open websites, type UN's and Passwords, try to memorize the key steps in building and mainintiaining lists compared to creating environments and software that never sees working light.
               
              the other .exe file with keyboard shortcuts launching on Power Up w/keyboard shortcuts to launch services locally, check pipeline health, retrieve reports from last login, 
              make sure scheduler for vm's is filled with content and everythings connected.
                                             
             BUILD YOUR Automated Virtual KVM - KVM SWITCH THAT RIVALS DOING IT YOURSELF 
             PLUS WITH THIS TPYE OF AUTOMATI0N WE CAN ENJOY WATCHING THE COMPUTER DO IT INBETWEEN ACTIONS
             AUTOMATED SOUND BOARD RESPONDER THAT TAKES CRONTROL OF KEYBOARD AND MOUNSE (WITH IMAGE/TEXT RECOGNITION) SOFTWARE /// SET TIMERS /// AUDIO TRIGGERS /// INTERACTIVE CUSTOM TRAINING /// IMAGE REC COMPLETION CHECKPOINT SHEETS (LIKE SPRITE SHEETS TAKEN FROM JUMPING AHEAD THE USER MANUAL DURRING A TEST)


3: Project 1 - Use repo project 1 download as a mp3 template for responding to each sound on a y=10 n=0 noise to emotional intnent juding panel
               Cycle through loops playing audio clip sound boards based on idel timers, response scores and completion of projects in a timely manor 
               If you have the time or passion make 1-3 more custom sound boards with a desired theme and share results.

3: Project 2 - NLP response game augmented faces - Shock value at the look on the receivers face when they see you after sending NLP responses.
                                                   Auto scentence completion to match the emotions shown on face with severity or lightnss of message in addition to how you react to last heard statment 
                                                   based on sentient intent on a 1-10 pain scale typed on keyboard and then summed into 3 responses to be fine-tuned one more time to then be sent. 

4: Project 3 - Nose to mouse, click to smile/blink/pause, response click events // click path completion software designed to be egonomically faster than a standard mousepad and efficent 

5: Project 4 - Make your webcam turn your display into a "relative" touch screen creating a B/W checkerboard overlay thats displays flat on screen and heat maps in combination with face/comprehension completion benching for type time/mouse clicks speed benching and vizualy aknowledged end point narrowed with eyes, nose, expression and annoyance level, as well as current personal mood and energy taken into account
        
6: Project 5 - take a minute and make sure you can get to this point without clicking more than a button. Or at least run the .exe and get guided when seen fit
Fix 1-3 bugs and share findings - if someone else is working on same thing work with them and expand data findings or spend availability....
