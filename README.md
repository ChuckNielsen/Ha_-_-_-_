Step 2: Automating with Sikulix.jar + Screen Saver Project

This repo is designed to be an interactive programming tool that sits on your desktop waiting to repeate what its observed faster to allow you to intelligently enjoy certian automation hurdles. 

# Hard @pps is the future bridge of interacting with traditional computers and wearable AR/VR devices
# stuck on the keyboard? **** Design around the "idleAUTO" mindset: Obtaining through Enriching - A measurment of actionable diffrence the software has helped to create in your life from applied machine learning and automation macro link forests.

Training steps for ML: in session///post session///test results/// ScrapeSave Training Results /// Questioneers filled out automatically and only sometimes manually at any step

All levels welcome, 9 Repos are in Phase 1 of Hard @pps 
Each with a new type of automation environment software feature integration and customization beyond the scope of this Repo.
Steps - 
1 Auto Hot Keys
2 Sikilux
3 .yaml, Conda, Docker, Kubernettes, Pythonm, NodeDB, JavaScript, Webapps, Site Host Services, VPN 's with ability to rotate every step of an automated task

9 have a next step game shark like avatar guide 3d media agency content created to generate even more layers and options 
10 cretique and revamp delivery of approval items and generate timeline reports for these segments all forms filled automaticly from keyword+analytically generated task lists 

Automation tools - freely available to download and setup your machine env as seen fit. Cross automation files acomplishing the same thing with ability to transfer services to a diffrence program solution another instance with diffrent settings and integrate advanced transfter learning and feature engineering speedups we get from collaborating and sharing while maintaing to certian best guidliens.


Follow steps below to begin continue setting up:


1: Open cmd and download this git repo from copying url in address bar or green button above 
****ADD DETAIL IF NEEDED**** (need to have program that clips images after holding 2 buttons click and drag is activated until 2 keys are lifted and image is saved of button add it to click event map pool set)

2: The .apk are AutoHotKey files that are saved in notebook files with the .txt at the end of the file name (not always noticed) make sure to click file name and drop the ".apk" extension  (HINT:: for future name changes remember to change the file type to all files).

3: Then open the auto hot key software for Windows ($$$$$) and convert the file using Ahk2Exe Script to Exe Converter
- Now you can launch the file as a non editable .exe file
- Schedule to auto launch at startup
- Keyboard combo shortcuts: C+D auto types a website in a new browser window /// type a sentence /// open a file with CMD and run a .py script // launch react //
-       Timers to play chime/alarm after delays or data capture moments to make your screen a less idally restrictive from auto scentence completion and nose to mouse click to smile/blink/pause response click events// 10 seconds of not clicking a text prompt
-       Cycle through loops playing files and autio cues for how to in addition to text boxes

- "AMP-BOARD" macro "PACKS" (keyboard overlay pack for photoshop/email/open program/program shortcuts based on job or cycle)
-
-
-  Get 2 .exe files with keyboard shortcuts launching on Power Up w/keyboard shortcuts to close each seperately.  cross-script click route mappings based on job resource and availability mappings.
